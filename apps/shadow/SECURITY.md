# Security Policy

**Shadow** is an open-source component of [Ryu](https://ryuhq.com), maintained by
A Major Pte. Ltd.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities **privately** — do not open a public issue or pull request.

- Email **security@ryuhq.com** with details and reproduction steps, or
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting ("Security" → "Report a vulnerability") on this
  repository.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 3 business days and to share a remediation timeline after
triage. Please give us a reasonable window to ship a fix before public disclosure; we're glad to
credit you once a fix is released.

## Supported versions

Security fixes target the latest released version on `main`. Older versions are not maintained.

## Sensitive-capability note

Shadow exposes screen, audio, and input capture — capabilities with an inherently elevated security and privacy surface.
Inside Ryu they run only behind explicit user consent. If you embed this component, treat it as a
high-trust dependency: gate it behind clear consent, restrict who can invoke it, and audit its
inputs and outputs.
